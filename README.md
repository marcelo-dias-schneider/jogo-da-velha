# Tic-Tac-Toe 

> A simple tic-tac-toe game made with pure JavaScript Vanilla, HTML, and CSS.

## About the Project

This project was developed right after I learned JavaScript, as a way to practice and consolidate my knowledge. The game is fully functional, with a graphical interface, scoreboard, and allows you to play using the mouse or keyboard.

## Features
- Player X vs Player O
- Change player names
- Scoreboard up to 5 points
- Automatic win or draw detection
- Keyboard support (numpad)
- Fullscreen mode
- Responsive interface

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on a cell to make your move.
3. Use the numeric keypad to play (7-8-9, 4-5-6, 1-2-3).
4. Click on the player's name to change it.
5. The first to reach 5 points wins!
